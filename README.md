This is my personal development fork of `bbcp`, a fast network file copy tool that's popular amongst the HPC community.

If `scp` was a car, `bbcp` would be a hotrod. It puts you in control over a broad spectrum of options, allowing you to optimize the transfer for your specific environment and your particular use-case.

For more info, see the [official BBCP project page][1].
